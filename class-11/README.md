# Intro to Data Science with Numpy

Python has a vibrant community of Data Science professionals and enthusiasts. The array of tools can be overwhelming, but one thing most of them have in common is the use of Numpy (aka Numeric Python) under the hood.

The tool of choice for most are Jupyter Notebooks.
